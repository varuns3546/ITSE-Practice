                <h2>I have been coding since I was very young and <em>quite</em> enjoy it.</h2>
                My favorite languages are <strong>Python</strong> &amp; <strong>JavaScript</strong>
                My first taste of coding was in elementary school when I started using Scratch.
                Scratch is a website where you can use pre-made blocks that represent code to create programs.
                I went on to learn java in highschool where I took four years of computer science classes.
                After highschool I began working in Python which ended up becoming my favorite language.
                Most recently I have been developing my skills in JavaScript.
